      <h3>A boilerplate for creating superb style guides</h3>
      <p>
        The homepage of a style guide should provide high-level information
        around what the design system is, what benefits it provides, who itâ€™s
        for, and how to get started with it. Like any good index page, it should
        provide clear navigation to key parts of the website.
