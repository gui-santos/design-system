# Design System Documentation

This documentation was created based on the
[gatsby-documentation-starter](https://github.com/whoisryosuke/gatsby-documentation-starter),  
which uses MDX, react-docgen, and GatsbyJS to generate documentation for React components.

The project is also hosted using Netlify here:

## How to run it

In the directory of the project, run:

```
yarn install
yarn dev

Go to http://localhost:8000

## Storybook

To develop the components independently, I used Storybook. To check all the stories, just run:

yarn storybook
```
